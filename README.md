The colour scheme was chosen to complement the colours in the images, frame the pages of the website and provide contrast for good readability of the information.
The colour palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).




## Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to add the following fonts:
- 'Trirong' is used for headings and to provide visual contrast for navigation links when in use.
- 'Open sans' is used for the body text of the site, this is a clean and easy to read font.
- 'Sans serif' is used as a fallback font in the event the font can not be imported into the site correctly.

[Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) was used to choose fonts that have good visual contrast.





## Imagery
The images used in the website were chosen to reflect the content of the pages and the information they accompany. They are intended to promote the products and services provided by the business and entice users to become customers.


The 'Gallery' page images were selected for the close up format and the dark background of the images to ensure the focus is on the products and provide consistent style in the gallery. These images are displayed with a ratio of 1:1 to provide a clean layout across all sizes of device.
